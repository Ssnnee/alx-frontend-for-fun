# Alx-for-fun

Alx-for-fun is a repository for optional projects that I have done for fun.

## Markdown to HTML

The Python script `markdown2html.py` converts a markdown file to an HTML file.

> For some reason, did not pass alx checks, but it works fine I think.

## Form

This project is about form. We dive into some advanced form features like validation,
error messages, and more using HTML and CSS.

## Accessibility

Here, we explore the concept of accessibility in web development.
When designing a website, it is important to consider the needs of all users,
including those with disabilities.
